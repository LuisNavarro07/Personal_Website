        My research interests lie at the intersection of fiscal federalism, local tax policy, financial management, and municipal debt. I am particularly interested in how interactions between different levels of government shape state and local policies, economic outcomes, and their impact on debt markets. I also conduct research to understand how tax policy influences the development of new markets.

        I graduated with a PhD in Public Affairs (Public Finance and Public Policy) from Indiana University, Bloomington. This Fall (2025) I'll join the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington, as an Assistant Professor.
