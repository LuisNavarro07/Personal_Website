      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''

        I am public finance/budgeting scholar with research interests that lie within the intersections of fiscal federalism, local tax policy, financial management and municipal debt. I am particularly interested in how the interactions between governments from different levels shape state and local policies, economic outcomes, as well as their impact on debt markets. Also, I do research to understand how tax policy influences the development of new markets.
        A stream of my research analyzes the role of federal aid on state and local debt markets. In my solo-authored paper "Federal Assistance and Municipal Borrowing: Unpacking the Effects of the CARES Act on Government Liquidity Management" (Michael Curro Award Best Graduate Student Paper 2024), and my joint work with Felipe Lozano Rojas "  Liquidity and Volatility in the Municipal Bond Market: Evidence from the Municipal Liquidity Facility and other early interventions" (Under review Journal of Financial Intermediation) I explore the mechanisms through which federal interventions improve access to debt financing and restore investor confidence during periods of turmoil.
        In a similar line, in my dissertation research "Cash Reserves and Short-Term Debt Under Liquidity Constraints" I develop and test a theory that shows how capitalization levels influence the decision to manage cash-flows via cash reserves and short-term borrowing.
        My teaching experience includes several sections of SPEA V202: Contemporary Economics Issues for Public Affairs (undergraduate microeconomics for public policy analysis) as well as a Lab Instructor role for SPEA V506: Statistical Analysis for Effective Decision Making (graduate statistics) in which I teach R programming for statistical analysis.
