abstract: We examine the role of charitable food assistance during periods of economic distress by looking at donations to a large Midwestern food bank. First, we explore the historical determinants of in-kind food and financial donations, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that both in-kind and financial donations dramatically increased at the onset of the pandemic but these increases were not persistent. As a result, we argue that this is evidence of the charitable food system serving as an "automatic nutritional stabilizer" in accepting charitable donations on behalf of households in need during times of crisis.
