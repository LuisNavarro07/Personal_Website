title: Federal Assistance and Municipal Borrowing Unpacking the Effects of the CARES Act on Government Liquidity Management

event: Brookings 13th Annual Municipal Finance Conference

abstract: "Access to cash can affect the ability of local governments to respond to
crises. Federal aid to local governments can supply this directly, though the
effectiveness on a dollar-per-dollar basis depends on its complementary or substitutability
with local borrowing. Through this lens this paper examines the
effects of the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) on local governments borrowing
using a regression discontinuity design that exploits the quasi-experimental
setting induced by the fund eligibility criterion imposed by the US Treasury.
The findings indicate that recipient governments observed mild reductions in
borrowing costs and increased their debt issuance on the primary market, with
no significant spillovers to the secondary market. Moreover, this analysis provides
some suggestive evidence on the liquidity management undertaken by
local governments. It documents an increase in the issuance of short-term
debt, at the expense of reductions on the issuance of longer-term bonds. Together,
these findings shed some light on the mechanisms through which federal
aid to local governments translates into improved borrowing conditions on the
bond market."
